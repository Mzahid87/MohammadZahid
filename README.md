Article Classification using LSTM Model

Description

Text documents are essential as they are one of the richest sources of data for businesses. Text documents often contain crucial information which might shape the market trends or influence the investment flows. Therefore, companies often hire analysts to monitor the trend via articles posted online, tweets on social media platforms such as Twitter or articles from newspaper. However, some companies may wish to only focus on articles related to technologies and politics. Thus, filtering of the articles into different categories is required.
Often the categorization of the articles is conduced manually and retrospectively; thus, causing the waste of time and resources due to this arduous task. Hence, your job as a machine learning engineer is tasked to categorize unseen articles into 5 categories namely Sport, Tech, Business, Entertainment and Politics.
